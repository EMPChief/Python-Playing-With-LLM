The inputs are the numbers on which you want to perform the operation, and the operation type. If the entered operation type is not one of the four predefined ones (1, 2, 3, 4 for respective operations), then the program will prompt to enter a valid operation type. If the type is '5', the program will exit. For division, if the second input is zero, it will show an error message.\n"
