        "content": "Sure! Here is an example of a simple Python calculator using classes:\n\n```python\nclass Calculator:\n    def add(self, x, y):\n        return x + y\n\n    def subtract(self, x, y):\n        return x - y\n\n    def multiply(self, x, y):\n        return x * y\n\n    def divide(self, x, y):\n        if y == 0:\n            return \"Error: Division by zero!\"\n        else:\n            return x / y\n\n# Example usage\ncalc = Calculator()\nprint(\"Addition:\", calc.add(5, 3))\nprint(\"Subtraction:\", calc.subtract(5, 3))\nprint(\"Multiplication:\", calc.multiply(5, 3))\nprint(\"Division:\", calc.divide(5, 3))\n```\n\nIn this example, I have created a class named `Calculator` with methods for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can create an instance of the `Calculator` class and then use its methods to perform calculations.\n\nFeel free to customize or expand this code as needed! Let me know if you have any specific requirements or additional functionality you would like to add."
